### consistency
The environment and operating system should be consistant and almost thematic. Suckless operating systems shouldn't use bloating software and vice versa. Green themed terminals in an otherwise purple operating system (unless it looks nice).

### aesthetics
Aesthetics are a big part and should be somewhat incorporated. This can be as heavy as editting every config that passes through your system to be red or as simple as adding some transparency to your terminal to make it look nice.

### usability
An operating system (this is aimed at rices) should be built with operability and workflow in mind. Whilst there is a space for purely aesthetics, operating systems were meant to be used even if you are only making them as a sport, make them as if they were to be used daily.
